Instructions

I have put all the program files inside
the HelloGit Directory to keep it organized.

1. Use Command "cd HelloGit" to open the
Directory and use any of the Git commands or
file operations.

2. I used python to code this so the command
to run my Ceasar Cipher would be the following.
"python3 mycipher.py 3 < plaintext"

3. The resulting output should be - FRQJU 
HVVVK DOOPD NHQRO DZUHV SHFWL QJDQH VWDEO 
LVKPH QWRIU HOLJL RQRUS URKLE LWLQJ WKHIU
HHHAH UFLVH WKHUH RIRUD EULGJ LQJWK HIUHH 
GRPRI VSHHF KRURI WKHSU HVVRU WKHUL JKWRI 
WKHSH RSOHS HDFHD EOBWR DVVHP EOHDQ GWRSH 
WLWLR QWKHJ RYHUQ PHQWI RUDUH GUHVV RIJUL 
HYDQF HV 

4. If you want to return the crypted text back 
to normal, simply save the file in this format
python3 mycipher.py 3 < plaintext > "file name"

Then  issue the same command with the decryption key 
(i.e. 26 - n; where n = 3) as follows.
python3 mycipher.py 23 < "filename" > "newfilename"

Should give you this output below
CONGR ESSSH ALLMA KENOL AWRES PECTI NGANE 
STABL ISHME NTOFR ELIGI ONORP ROHIB ITING

EFREE DOMOF SPEEC HOROF THEPR ESSOR THERI 
GHTOF THEPE OPLEP EACEA BLYTO ASSEM BLEAN 
DTOPE TITIO NTHEG OVERN MENTF ORARE DRESS 
OFGRI EVANC ES


5. You can create additional text files in
the HelloGit Directory and play around to see
different outputs! All you will need to do
is replace "plaintext" with the file name
that you want to test the Ceasar Cipher on.

Thank you!
